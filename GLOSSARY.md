Constant Rate Factor (CRF) is the default quality and rate control setting for
the x264 and x265 encoders. Allows the encoder to specify a certain quality level
when the filesize and bitrate are not limiting factors. See the [x264 page](/encoding/codecs/x264.md#-crf-24) for more information.

A Blu-ray Disc Movie (BDMV) is a Blu-ray video format with menu capabilities
